# Contributing

Suggestions, pull requests, and forks are welcome.

High-impact contribution areas:

- Packaging and distribution:
  - Linux packages (deb/rpm), Homebrew formulae, Scoop/Chocolatey, Arch/AUR, Nix, etc.
  - Release automation and artifact publication for multiple platforms.
- GUI frontends:
  - Desktop/web/mobile wrappers around the CLI pipeline.
  - Workflow-focused tools that call the sprat-cli commands under the hood.
- Engine/runtime integrations:
  - Importers/exporters and transform templates for specific game engines or frameworks.
  - Community-maintained presets and examples.
- CI/CD and developer tooling:
  - Cross-platform build/test matrices.
  - Reproducible packaging and versioned release pipelines.

Core scope remains a free UNIX-style CLI. GUI and platform integrations are encouraged as companion projects or optional layers.
